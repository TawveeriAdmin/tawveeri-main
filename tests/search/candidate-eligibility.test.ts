/**
 * CANDIDATE ELIGIBILITY, GENERICALLY (D→E mission, Section 6 — 2026-08-09).
 *
 * AUDITED FINDING: `/api/search`'s relevance/category gate only ever engages when the query
 * contains a recognized product-type noun (`isMainProductTypeQuery`) — for ANY sentence
 * without one, whatever the underlying fuzzy match (Algolia/Supabase) returned was served
 * completely unfiltered. `looksLikeSentenceNotProductQuery` closes that generically: a
 * sentence-shaped query with no product-type noun is not a product search regardless of WHY
 * it reached this endpoint, and gets the same honest-zero treatment `categoryEnforcedZero`
 * already applies to a failed category-scoped match.
